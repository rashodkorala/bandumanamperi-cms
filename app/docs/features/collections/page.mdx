# Collections Management

Complete guide to viewing and managing your artwork collections.

## Overview

Collections (also called Series) allow you to organize related artworks into groups. The Collections view provides a dedicated interface to browse, search, and manage your artwork collections.

## What are Collections?

Collections are groups of artworks that share a common **Series** name. When you assign the same Series name to multiple artworks, they automatically form a collection.

### Collection Benefits

1. Navigate to **Collections** in the sidebar
2. View all collections with their artworks
3. Each collection is displayed as a card with:

## Managing Collections

   - Or use Common Defaults in bulk upload

2. **When Editing**:
   - Edit artwork
   - Set or change Series field
   - Artwork moves to appropriate collection

### Removing Artworks from Collections

1. **Edit Artwork**:
   - Clear the Series field
   - Artwork is removed from collection

2. **Delete Artwork**:
   - Delete artwork from collection view
   - Artwork is removed from collection and database

### Renaming Collections

To rename a collection:

  <AlertDescription>
    Collection names are case-sensitive. "Body Works" and "body works" are different collections. Use consistent naming conventions to avoid creating duplicate collections.

## Collection Organization Tips

### Naming Conventions

- **Be Consistent**: Use the same format for all collection names
- **Be Descriptive**: Use clear, meaningful names
- **Avoid Duplicates**: Check existing collections before creating new ones

### Organization Strategies

1. **By Theme**: Group artworks by subject matter
   - Example: "Urban Landscapes", "Portraits", "Abstract Works"

2. **By Series**: Group artworks from the same series
   - Example: "Body Works Series 2023", "Nature Studies 2024"

3. **By Exhibition**: Group artworks shown together
   - Example: "Gallery Show 2023", "Solo Exhibition 2024"

4. **By Medium**: Group artworks by technique
   - Example: "Oil Paintings", "Digital Works", "Mixed Media"

## Collection Statistics

Each collection displays:

- **Total Artworks**: Number of artworks in collection
- **Published Count**: Number of published artworks
- **Draft Count**: Number of draft artworks

Use these stats to:
- Track collection completeness
- Identify collections needing publication
- Balance published vs draft content

## Frontend Integration

Collections can be used to organize artworks for frontend display:

### API Endpoints

- **All Collections**: Get unique collection names via `/api/artworks?series=...`
- **Collection Artworks**: Filter artworks by collection name
- **Featured Collections**: Display featured artworks from collections

### Display Options

1. **Collection Pages**: Create pages for each collection
2. **Collection Galleries**: Display collection grids on homepage
3. **Collection Navigation**: Add collection filters to artwork pages

<Alert variant="info">
  <AlertTitle>API Usage</AlertTitle>
  <AlertDescription>
    Use the artworks API with series filter to fetch artworks by collection. Example: <code>/api/artworks?series=Body%20Works</code> returns all artworks in the "Body Works" collection.

## Best Practices

### Collection Management

1. **Plan Collections**: Decide on collection structure before uploading
2. **Use Common Defaults**: Set collection during bulk upload
3. **Review Regularly**: Check Collections view to ensure organization
4. **Consolidate**: Merge duplicate collections with same name variations

### Workflow Tips

1. **Bulk Upload**: Use bulk upload with collection defaults for new series
2. **Edit in Batches**: Edit multiple artworks to assign to collections
3. **Search First**: Search existing collections before creating new ones
4. **Use Tags**: Combine collections with tags for flexible organization

## Troubleshooting

### Collections Not Appearing

- **Check Series Field**: Ensure artworks have Series names assigned
- **Refresh Page**: Collections update when data refreshes
- **Check Filters**: Clear search query to see all collections

### Artworks Not Grouping

- **Exact Match**: Series names must match exactly (case-sensitive)
- **Spaces**: Check for extra spaces in Series names

### Missing Artworks in Collection
